title: "Don't let Doug Ford chip away at our Countryside!"
info: |
  In April 2023, the Ontario government removed a 70-hectare farm in southwest Kitchener from the Countryside, re-designating it as “urban” without protecting an equivalent amount of new rural land. This was the first time our Countryside Line has been breached.<br /><br />
  
  If the Countryside Line is to remain an effective planning tool, we must find 70 hectares of land to add back into the rural area.<br /><br />
  
  Over the last several months, Hold The Line WR has discussed this idea with councillors and staff. There are several properties of publicly-owned lands adjacent to the Countryside Line that might be best suited for an urban-to-rural redesignation. These could include municipal woodlots, parks, recreation areas, or conservation areas that are currently designated "urban". The intent of this proposal is not to remove existing residential land from development.<br /><br />
  
  <strong>Q: Does this constitute an appeal of the Province's decision?</strong><br /><br />
  
  A: No. While the Province’s decision is not subject to appeal, the Region does have the authority to adjust the Countryside Line at any time. It should use this power to restore balance to the Countryside.<br /><br />
  
  The provincially-approved Regional Official Plan Amendment includes all the existing policies related to the Countryside Line, including policy 1.6.4 which states, "If required, any future expansions of the Urban Area and Township Urban Area boundaries must be within the Countryside Line."<br /><br />
  
  <strong>Q: Aren't municipal parks and conservation areas already protected?</strong><br /><br />
  
  A: There are some other policy tools, such as zoning and natural heritage policies, that help protect land from development. But several of these sites are still designated "urban" in the Regional Official Plan. Re-designating them as "rural" or "protected countryside" would offer greater protection, and would show that the Region will not tolerate those who wish to chip away at the countryside.<br /><br />
  
  <strong>Q: Hasn't the Region been stripped of its authority for land-use planning?</strong><br /><br />
  
  A: No. Ontario's Bill 23, which achieved royal assent in December 2022, allows for the removal of the Region's planning authority. However, these regulations have not been prescribed yet. The Region should not shy away from protecting our countryside just because its planning authority may soon be transferred to area municipalities.<br /><br />
  
  If we do not make the Countryside whole again, this will be the first time that Waterloo Region’s long-term growth boundary is breached. And it will not be the last. The abandonment of the “one hectare in, one hectare out” principle means that land speculators can justify further breaches of the Countryside Line. We have already seen multiple real estate advertisements for land in the protected countryside as a "future boundary expansion" opportunity. The Region cannot remain silent. Please tell Regional Council that we must continue to Hold The Line.

  I am writing to support Mayor McCabe’s motion regarding the protection of the Countryside Line (item 17.1 in Wednesday’s council meeting agenda).
  
  Waterloo Region's Countryside Line has protected our drinking water, farms, and natural areas from the harmful effects of excessive urban sprawl since it was introduced 20 years ago. It is a major reason why we are able to grow transit-supportive neighbourhoods while keeping our rural character. Over the years, minor adjustments have been made to the Countryside Line, but never to expand the total amount of urban land. For every hectare of rural land converted to "urban", an equivalent amount of urban land was protected as "rural".
  
  In April 2023, the Ontario government upset this balance. It removed a 70-hectare farm in southwest Kitchener from the Countryside, re-designating it as “urban” without protecting an equivalent amount of new rural land.
  
  This was the first time that our Countryside Line has been breached. If the Countryside Line is to remain intact, we must find 70 hectares of “urban” land to add back into the rural area.
  
  There are many properties that could make good candidates for this. Staff could consider publicly-owned lands adjacent to the Countryside Line such as municipal woodlots, parks, recreation areas, or conservation areas that are currently designated "urban". Nobody is proposing to remove existing residential land from development.
  
  The Region has the authority to adjust the Countryside Line at any time, and this is something it can do without launching an appeal of the province’s decision.
  
  Ontario has passed Bill 23, which allows for the removal of the Region's planning authority. However, the date of that transition has not been set yet. The Region should not shy away from protecting our countryside just because its planning authority may soon be transferred to area municipalities.
  
  We cannot not tolerate the chipping away of our Countryside. If the Region remains silent, it will send a message that we’ve given up on smart, sustainable growth planning. Please, do the right thing. Ask staff to designate 70 hectares of new countryside to restore the balance of our rural and urban lands.
