title: 'Restore our countryside & reaffirm ROPA 6'
info: |
  In 2022, the Region of Waterloo passed the new Regional Official Plan Amendment, known as ROPA 6. It’s a good plan that keeps the countryside line intact and plans for complete transit-supportive communities.<br /><br />
  
  In April 2023, the Province unilaterally changed that plan. It opened up huge swaths of our Region for development and low-density sprawl. The countryside line was breached, with the urban boundary expanding out into the moraine that gives us our drinking water.<br /><br />
  
  Since then, the former Minister of housing resigned in disgrace. There are ongoing investigations into the Province's decisions related to the Greenbelt and land use. As a result, the Province announced it’s totally reversing course. They realise how much they’ve eroded public trust.<br /><br />
  
  The province is asking municipalities to re-submit their plans. We are calling on Region of Waterloo councillors to reaffirm their support for ROPA 6, exactly as it was approved by Council just 14 months ago. This is not an opportunity to play around with more amendments, or to adopt any of the Province's flawed decisions. We want certainty that our Regional Government will stand by its decisions and defend our countryside line.<br /><br />

  Restore the Official Plan, reject
  Provincial overreach
message: |
  I am writing to express my support for the Region's Official Plan Amendment No. 6 (ROPA 6), as it was approved by Regional Council back in August 2022. This decision was the result of over two years of consensus-building and public consultation.
  
  Our plan provides more than enough room to meet our housing targets, protects our countryside line, and includes a responsible amount of new greenfield development area. It helps us move away from costly sprawl and towards more liveable, transit-oriented, mixed-use communities with more variety in housing types.
  
  The Provincial government is mired in controversy with regard to their decisions on the Greenbelt and official plans across Ontario. The Province's unilateral changes to our plan in 2023 should never have happened, and we should not be considering keeping any of them.
  
  The former Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs has resigned, and the new Minister admitted that those decisions were wrong. It's notable that the Ontario government has rightly announced their intention to reverse those changes, to avoid the perception of corruption.
  
  Now, city and township mayors have been given 35 days to provide the Province with feedback. Without public consultation, without consultation with First Nations, and without the input of elected members of Council nor professional staff.
  
  As a community, we must send a strong message against this approach. Our region, cities, and townships are at our best when we work together. And that's exactly what we did when creating ROPA 6.
  
  Just like our community rejected the use of "strong mayor" powers bestowed by the Province, it is again time to remind the Province what democracy looks like.
  
  I urge Regional Council, as well as all Area Municipal councils, to reaffirm the commitment to smart growth, intensification, and to maintaining the Countryside Line, and to reiterate support for ROPA 6, exactly as it was passed by Regional Council in 2022, and ask that the Province adopt it unchanged.
  
  Instead of falling for the Province's divide-and-conquer tactics, let's continue to uphold our long history of responsible and collaborative regional growth management.
