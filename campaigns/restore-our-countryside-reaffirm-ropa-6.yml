title: 'Restore our countryside & reaffirm ROPA 6'
info: |
  In 2022, the Region of Waterloo passed the new Regional Official Plan Amendment, known as ROPA 6. It’s a good plan that keeps the countryside line intact and plans for complete transit-supportive communities.<br /><br />
  
  In April 2023, the Province unilaterally changed that plan. It opened up huge swaths of our Region for development and low-density sprawl. The countryside line was breached, with the urban boundary expanding out into the moraine that gives us our drinking water.<br /><br />
  
  Since then, the former Minister of housing resigned in disgrace. There are ongoing investigations into the Province's decisions related to the Greenbelt and land use. As a result, the Province announced it’s totally reversing course. They realise how much they’ve eroded public trust.<br /><br />
  
  The province is asking municipalities to re-submit their plans. We are calling on Region of Waterloo councillors to reaffirm their support for ROPA 6, exactly as it was approved by Council just 14 months ago. This is not an opportunity to play around with more amendments, or to adopt any of the Province's flawed decisions. We want certainty that our Regional Government will stand by its decisions and defend our countryside line.<br /><br />

  Restore our countryside and reaffirm
  ROPA 6
message: |
  I am writing to express my support for the Region's Official Plan Amendment No. 6 (ROPA 6), as it was approved by Council back in August 2022. This decision, made just 14 months ago, was the result of consensus-building and public consultation over more than two years. This process included the voices of First Nations, residents of Waterloo Region, Provincial staff, local municipalities, agricultural organizations, environmental organizations, business organizations, housing groups, the Grand River Conservation Authority, community groups, property owners, developers, and more.
  
  It's a plan that provides lots of room to exceed our housing targets, protects our countryside line and includes a responsible amount of new greenfield development area. It helps us move away from costly sprawl and towards more liveable, transit-oriented, mixed-use communities with more variety in housing types.
  
  The Provincial government is mired in controversy with regard to their decisions on the Greenbelt and official plans across Ontario. The Province's unilateral changes to our plan in 2023 should never have happened, and we should not be considering keeping any of them.
  
  The former Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs has resigned, and the new Minister admitted that those decisions were wrong. It's notable that the Ontario government has rightly announced their intention to reverse those changes, to avoid the perception of corruption.
  
  Now, in an effort to shift blame to our local leaders, the Province has given our community 45 days to provide them with our plans. This does not give nearly enough time to conduct proper consultation, and we should stick with the approved ROPA 6 in its entirety.
  
  A letter from the Minister on November 2nd has revealed that the Province may only be seeking feedback from individual cities and townships on this issue, not the Region of Waterloo as a whole. This is ludicrous and unacceptable. The Region must not accept this premise, as the Region still has planning responsibilities which have not been removed.
  
  The mayors of Kitchener and Waterloo declared that they have no intention of using their "strong mayor powers", and for good reason. Similarly, the feedback from municipalities should come from Council as a whole, not just the Mayor's office. I hope that city and township councils also reject the Minister's letter for its anti-democratic assumptions, which would pit our communities against each other.
  
  Now is not the time to open up this can of worms. The fair path forward is simple: I urge you to reiterate your support for ROPA 6, exactly as it was passed by Regional Council in 2022, and ask that the Province adopt it unchanged.
  
  I also ask that city and township councils reiterate their support for the Regional planning process. Instead of falling for the Province's divide-and-conquer tactics, let's continue to uphold our long history of responsible and collaborative regional growth management.
